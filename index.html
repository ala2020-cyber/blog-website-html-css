        <h1>The 14 Greatest Achievements of Elon Musk</h1>
        <!---introduction for this section-->
        <p class="parg">Elon Musk is  <span> a man of many talents</span>. Indeed, while some may know him as the face behind Tesla,  <span> a leading automotive company</span>, others recognise him from his ambitious pursuits to colonise other planets.

            Over the years, <span>the ambitious entrepreneur </span> has had lots of irons in the fire and has led multiple noteworthy ventures. It seems that Musk is in a restless pursuit of pioneering technology, ground-breaking innovations and sustainable developments. Indeed,<span> he has achieved a fleet of accomplishments on his way to the top</span>.
            
            Without further ado, here are 14 of Elon Musk’s greatest achievements.</p>
        <!--achivement of him-->
        <ol>
            <li>He read the entire Encyclopaedia Britannica at nine years old</li>
            <a target='_blank' href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica"><img src="https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2012/03/britannicae.jpg?alias=standard_900x600" alt="Encyclopaedia Britannica" ></a>
            <p class='content'>Musk was an avid reader from a very young age. He would spend, on average, 10 hours a day reading science fiction novels and anything else he could get his hands on. In fact, at the age of nine, he ran out of books to read at the 
            library, so he ended up reading the entire Encyclopaedia Britannica before he finished fourth grade.</p>
            
            <li>He taught himself to programme in three days</li>
            <img src="https://www.computersciencedegreehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Brief-History-of-Programming-Languages.jpg" alt="programming" >
            <p id="one">Musk’s interest in technology started evolving when he was 10 years old. Determined to teach himself more about programming, he learned the BASIC language after finishing a six-month course within just three days. His efforts were not in vain, either: at 12 
            years old, he managed to create his own video game and sell its code for the respectable amount of $500.</p>
            
            <li>He landed his first internship with a cold-call</li>
            <a target='_blank' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internship"><img src="https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/internship-concept-vector-illustration-banner-260nw-665304586.jpg" alt=""></a>
            <p id="two">While in college, Musk made a habit of calling executives he read about in magazines and asking them to meet for lunch. Indeed, this bold stunt landed him his very first internship at the Bank of Nova Scotia. His experience there
             was particularly useful, as years later he would go on to launch his own online finance business.</p>
            
            <li>He ran a speakeasy to pay rent</li>
            <a target='_blank' href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speakeasy"><img src="https://d3emaq2p21aram.cloudfront.net/media/cache/venue_roundup_single_image_flex/uploads/Barbershop-DavidJCrewe-01.jpg" alt="photo about speakeasy"></a>
            <p class="content">As a self-funded college student, Musk had to come up with inventive ways to earn some income, a problem to which he found an ingenious solution to: rent a 10-bedroom
             frat house and turn it into a club. According to Musk, he and his roommate would make an entire month’s rent in just one night!
            </p>
            
            <li>He completed a double major</li>
            <a target='_blank' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_majors_in_the_United_States"><img src="https://studybreaks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/maxresdefault-9.jpg" alt="photo about double major"></a>
            <p id="three">After spending two years at Queen’s University in Kingston, Canada, Musk transferred to the University of Pennsylvania on a full scholarship ride. There, he pursued a double
             major in business and physics and graduated from the prestigious Wharton School.</p>
            
             <li>He sold his first company for $307 million</li>
            <a target='_blank' href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip2"><img src="https://topicimages.mrowl.com/large/prithvi_c/elonmusk/career/zip2_1.jpg" alt=" photo of cofounder of zip2 "></a>
            <p id="four">On his first bid to make a break in the internet industry, Musk collaborated with his brother Kimbal to start their own company, Zip2. It wasn’t long before their startup was sold to a bigger company for a whopping 
            $307 million. This transaction landed Musk with $22 million – not too bad for a 27-year-old!</p>
            
            <li>He cofounded PayPal</li>
            <a target='_blank' href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal"><img src="https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/topcompare-blogassets/blog/fr_BE/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/28103001/cc-bloglc-header-418042027.jpg" alt="paypal company"></a>
            <p id="five">PayPal was the result of a merger between Musk’s startup X.com and Confinity, a competitor internet finance company. Musk served as the CEO of PayPal after the merger, but his executive years were shortlived as he was fired while on his honeymoon. Despite the fallback, he remained on the board and continued investing in PayPal. In fact, his contributions played an instrumental role when
            the company was sold to eBay two years later for a whopping $1.5 billion, earning Musk $180 million.</p>
            
            <li>He founded SpaceX</li>
            <a target='_blank' href="https://www.spacex.com/"><img src="https://images.rtl.fr/~c/770v513/rtl/www/1283216-la-fusee-falcon-heavy-de-spacex-est-decrite-comme-la-plus-puissante-du-monde.jpg" alt="spaceX company "></a>
            <p id="six">Before the PayPal sale was even finalised, Musk diverted his interests to space exploration. The business mogul was determined to make space travel more accessible, and in a bid to develop and manufacture his own space launch vehicles, SpaceX was established in 2002. By 2006, the space rocket company landed a
             contract with NASA to handle scheduled cargo transport to the International Space Station in 2008.</p>
            
            <li>He created the Musk Foundation</li>
            <a target='_blank' href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/852133087"><img src="https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20210422006203/fr/873534/22/XPCR_Musk-Foundation_Black.jpg" alt=""></a>
            <p id="seven">In 2002, Musk and his brother set up a private foundation in support of four distinct areas: renewable energy research and advocacy, human space exploration research and advocacy, paediatric research, and science and engineering education. With almost $300 million 
             donated to date, his foundation has focused on disaster relief, AI and sustainable innovations.</p>
            
            
            <li>He became the CEO of Tesla</li>
            <a target='_blank' href="https://www.tesla.com/"><img src="https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/RT_elon_musk_tesla_model_s_sk_150319_16x9_1600.jpg" alt="tesla company"></a>
            <p class="content">Musk initially joined Tesla’s board of directors as its chairman in 2004. Being one of its lead investors, he assumed his role as CEO in 2007. His vision to build electric cars and 
             make way for a more sustainable future also made him the lead product architect of the company.</p>
            
            <li>He launched the Falcon 9 Rocket</li>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9"><img src="http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/42374725534_a653d1b7cb_k.jpg" alt="Falcon 9"></a>
            <p class="content">In 2012, the Falcon 9 rocket made its journey to the International Space Station with 1,000 pounds of supplies for the astronauts stationed there. The mission made SpaceX the first ever private company to send a
             spacecraft to the ISS, and Falcon 9 completed a fleet of other flights for NASA from thereon.</p>
            
            <li>He set the Hyperloop in motion</li>
            <a target='_blank' href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop"><img src="https://images.lpcdn.ca/924x615/201806/01/1551442-systeme-hyperloop-moyen-transport-futuriste.jpg" alt="hyperloop"></a>
            <p class="content">In another bid to revolutionise transportation technology, Musk introduced the Hyperloop in 2013. Its main objective was to slash travel time between major cities via ultra-fast pods that would run on renewable energy. With several prototypes ran and tested, India and Missouri are the 
             first locations to have launched preliminary investigations for Hyperloop’s installation.</p>
            
            <li>He created OpenAI</li>
            <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI"><img src="https://www.robots-et-compagnie.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/openAI-1.jpg" alt="openAI"></a>
            <p class="content">In late 2015, Musk announced the creation of OpenAI, a San Francisco-based organisation aiming to advance artificial intelligence to benefit humanity and to develop AI technologies that can surpass the human brain. However, as Tesla became increasingly involved
             in AI, Musk had to step down as the OpenAI’s chairman in 2018 to avoid any conflict of interest.</p>
            
            <li> He cofounded Neuralink</li>
            <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink"><img src="https://www.geekqc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/finalmente-sapremo-neuralink-progetto-segreto-elon-musk-v3-388343.jpg" alt="neralink company"></a>
            <p class="content">As if space exploration, transportation tunnels and electric cars weren’t enough, Musk started a new passion project back in 2016. The business tycoon founded Neuralink, a neural tech company, with the aim of developing neurotechnology that could integrate artificial intelligence into the human brain.</p>
